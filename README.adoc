== ToDo
* [*] reconcile actor execute only 1 operation per reconciliation cycle
* [*] variables should be part of status
* [*] http request headers
* [*] grpcurl headers
* [ ] boyd functions: uuid generator at least
* [ ] response mutators. for example: response extracts http url and we need to get only one of parameters
* [ ] format support: request/response not only json should be user (it could be default value), but XML also required
* [*] body should have `row` field not `json`, as we could use xml format ether
* [ ] infinite or repeated actions which should finish due to some condition
